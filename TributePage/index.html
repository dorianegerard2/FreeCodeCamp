      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li><span class="bold">1867 -</span>Maria Sklodowska is born in Warsaw</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1891 -</span>Maria Sklodowska moves to Paris</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1895 -</span>Maria Sklodowska marries Pierre Curie.She now bears the name of Marie Curie.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1898 -</span>Pierre and Marie Curie discover radium.In front of the audience at the Academy of Sciences, Pierre and Marie Curie announce that they have succeeded in extracting a radioactive element from a mineral: radium.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1903 -</span>Pierre and Marie Curie receive the Nobel Prize in Physics</li>
     <li><span class="bold">1906 -</span>Marie Curie becomes a professor at the Sorbonne
At 39, the physicist becomes the first female professor at the Sorbonne. She will teach while continuing her research.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1911 -</span>She receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the isolation of radium
Marie Curie announces that she has succeeded in isolating metallic radium in its pure state. She was able to determine its atomic mass.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1914 -</span>Marie Curie creates the first mobile radiological service
During the First World War, Marie Curie wanted to put her work on radioactivity at the service of the war wounded. This is why it organizes the first mobile radiology service. Assisted by her daughter Irène, she fitted out 18 cars nicknamed "little Curies".</li>
<li><span class="bold">1914 -</span>Foundation of the Radium Institute
Created to reconcile scientific advances in radioactivity and medicine, the Institute is made up of two sections: the Pasteur pavilion, directed by Claudius Regaud and the Curie laboratory, directed by Marie Curie. After the war, CLaudius Regaud concentrated his activities on the fight against cancer by radiation. The Radium Institute merged with the Curie Foundation in 1970, giving birth to the Curie Institute.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1934 -</span>Marie Curie dies of leukemia
Caused by too long and too intense exposure to radiation, leukemia carried off Marie Curie, then 67 years old. She leaves the torch to her eldest daughter, Irène. Later, accompanied by her husband Frédéric Joliot, Irène Joliot-Curie would follow in the footsteps of her parents by discovering artificial radioactivity.</li>
<li><span class="bold">1995 -</span>Marie Curie becomes the first woman to enter the Pantheon on her own merits. Recognized as one of the greatest scholars of her time, now the most famous scientist in the world, she leaves behind an invaluable scientific and moral legacy.</li>
